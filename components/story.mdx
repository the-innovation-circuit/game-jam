We're inviting students to create a video game and submit it to the SG Game Jam. The creator of the best game will win $500, whilst the second and third place games will each receive $300 and $200 respectively.

The rules of the game jam are:

- Open for students aged up to 23
- Game must be appropriate for a PG13 audience
- Game must be built within the competition period

Thats all! You have full creative freedom to build whatever you'd like. If you're looking for a place to start, our friends at Hack Club has a [great set of workshops on game development](https://workshops.hackclub.com/#games).
