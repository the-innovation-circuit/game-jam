This November we're inviting students to create a video game and submit it to the SG Game Jam.  The creator of the best game will win a $500 e-voucher, whilst the two runners up will each earn a $250 e-voucher (the vouchers may be from any online retailer).

The rules of the game jam are:

-   Open for students aged 8 to 23
-   Game must be openable on either Windows or Mac
-   Game must be appropriate for a PG13 audience
-   Game must be built within the competition period

Thats all! You have full creative freedom to build whatever you'd like. If you're looking for a place to start, our partner Hack Club has a  [great set of workshops on game development](https://workshops.hackclub.com/#games).
