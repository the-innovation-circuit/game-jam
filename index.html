        SG GAME JAM
      </h1>
      <p>This November we're inviting students to create a video game and submit it to the SG Game Jam. <span style="font-weight: 500;">The creator of the best game will win a $500 e-voucher</span>, whilst the two runners up will each earn a $250 e-voucher (the vouchers may be from any online retailer).</p>
      <p>The rules of the game jam are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open for students aged 8 to 23 residing in South East Asia</li>
        <li>Game must be openable on either Windows or Mac</li>
        <li>Game must be appropriate for a PG13 audience</li>
        <li>Game must be built within November</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thats all! You have full creative freedom to build whatever you'd like. If you're looking for a place to start, our partner Hack Club has a <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/#games" style="color: white">great set of workshops on game development</a>.</p>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 500"><i>Once you've got a game, submit it here!</i></h4>
      <small>SG Game Jam is organised by the Innovation Circuit, a group of secondary school students.</small>
